My thesis for Georgetown University.
Adviser: Leeann Comfort

Data from New York's SPARCS data set on hospital inpatient discharges, County Health Rankings and Roadmaps (New York), and NASHP's HCT data set. 

Additional data not used in thesis from AHRQ. 

Look at the Quarto files uploaded as html files: for_rendering and HCRIS_added_data. 
Code from HCRIS_added_data may not run through because I initially did some manual cleaning due to facility identifiers not matching between data sets. You can likely work around that now that I have added more data sets and crosswalk data from other sources.
